I utilised google colab notebook for the aid of GPU. I saved and downloaded it as .py
file; however, that .py file may throw an error if you try to run it on your computer.

I saved all figures, logs and run-time screenshots in this folder.

I could not put some of them into the report since it was 2 column documents that makes
difficult to put these big images into that 2-column document. You may see all images from this folder.

Thank you!
